"""Rule-Based Control (RBC) model for AHU and zone setpoint management.

This module implements a simple rule-based controller that determines:
- Zone heating and cooling temperature setpoints (outdoor-compensated)
- Supply air temperature setpoint (return-air-compensated)
- AHU fan mass flow rate (schedule-based with CO2 demand boosting)

The control logic follows typical HVAC best practices for a DOAS
(Dedicated Outdoor Air System) with fan coil units.
